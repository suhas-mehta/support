Human Activity Recognition 🎥
=============================

Overview
--------

This tutorial uses data from the `Daily and Sports Activities Data Set <http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Daily+and+Sports+Activities>`_ 
from the UCI Machine Learning repository.  For this data set, human subjects had sensors 
placed at 5 locations on their bodies (each extremity and one on torso) and were recorded 
while repetitively executing 19 different activities.

Concepts covered
----------------

- Create a Falkonry Pipeline using signal data
- Upload verification examples and initiate learning cycle
- Make the pipeline "live"
- Add data to live pipeline, observe the recognized activities (condition assessments)
- Verify against known conditions

Instructions
------------
