Monitor
=======

Add more data
-------------

Once a good model revision is created as verified from the results of the revision, the 
pipeline can be used for continuous monitoring, in which case more data can be added to 
the pipeline. From the UI, this can be done either from an event buffer or from a pipeline
as shown in the video below.

Live Monitoring and Continued Learning 
--------------------------------------

From the Configure tab, the user can choose to **Open** the Outflow, in which case the most 
recent model revision is used to assess conditions in any existing or newly arriving data.
The user can alternatively choose a model first whereby the choice of available revisions
is presented for use to **Open** the outflow.

As soon as the user opens the outflow, live monitoring starts and assessments are produced
at the rate at which data arrives into the pipeline.  At any time, the user can initiate a
model revision and update the model used for live monitoring so that predictions can 
continue to improve.
