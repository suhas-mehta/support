Test
====

The **Test** tab provides a flexible way to test the accuracy of each model against different sets of data. 

In order to use the Test tab, the user must have already created a model revision in the `Learn <./learn.html>`_ 
tab. If multiple revisions exist, the user is able to choose which revision to test. Then the user will 
add another data set with facts that represent the expected results. Based on the first model, Falkonry
will assess conditions for the new data and produce results similarly to the Monitor tab.

Unlike the Monitor tab, the Test tab allows testing multiple sets of data that do not follow the time 
stamp of previous data. Also, Falkonry does not change its model when processing a test data set.

Here is an example of creating tests with the Human Activity Data:
