Accessing the Falkonry Service
==============================

There are two ways to deploy and use the Falkonry Service depending on your specific 
business needs and requirements.

Service Cloud
-------------

The simplest way to get immediate and effortless access to the Falkonry service is to take 
advantage of the `Falkonry Service Cloud <https://service.falkonry.io>`_. This allows you to 
focus on creating and refining your pipelines while leaving the infrastructure management 
and maintenance to us. 

When you sign up for the Falkonry Service Cloud, a free Personal account is created for 
you to experiment and learn about the Falkonry Service. You can use your account on the 
Service Cloud to test and evaluate all major functions of the Falkonry Service. If your 
piloting needs exceed the limits of a Personal account (e.g. higher data volumes, greater 
numbers of signals, multiple users), you can purchase a Team account with expanded 
capabilities.


Private Deployment
------------------

The Falkonry Service can be also be deployed into customer-managed virtual private clouds 
on IaaS, or directly onto customer managed compute and storage infrastructure.  There are 
three specific choices then for private deployments:

- VPC deployment on public IaaS cloud providers (Oracle Cloud, MS Azure, or Google Compute 
  Engine): Take advantage of pre-configured deployment environments.
- Docker Deployment: Download Falkonry tarball file and install into standard Linux or  
  docker-supported bare-metal or virtualized systems
- Install into private Kubernetes environment
